<h1>Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis</h1>




<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves the analysis and visualization of electric vehicle (EV) registration data. The objective is to understand the trends in EV adoption, distribution, and performance over time. Using various data analysis techniques and visualization tools, we aim to uncover insights about the EV market.
<br />


<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Data Import and Cleaning</h3>
- <b>Data Import:</b> Load the dataset from a CSV file.<br />
- <b>Data Cleaning:</b> Handle missing values by dropping rows with null values.

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
- <b>Dataset Overview:</b> Display the first few rows of the dataset and summarize its structure.<br />
- <b>Null Values Analysis:</b> Identify and count null values in each column.
  
<h3>Visualization</h3>
- <b>EV Adoption Over Time:</b> Plot the number of EV registrations by model year to show trends over time.<br />
- <b>Geographical Distribution:</b> Analyze and visualize the distribution of EVs at the county and city levels.<br />
